##### What is multithreading?

Parallel computing efficiently.
Multithreading **allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time**. These parts are known as threads and are lightweight processes  available within the process. So multithreading leads to maximum  utilization of the CPU by multitasking.

#####  What is recursion?

In computer science, recursion is **a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem**. 

 Describe a time you faced a challenge and how you resolved it. Talk about a big project you've worked on, how big it is, lines of code, current users, etc.

Describe some search algorithms. Describe the lock and key algorithm.

Write a function to detect loop in a linked list.

Similar to (283. Move Zeroes) on LeetCode, except instead of moving zeros to the end of the array (which is pretty trivial), had to move zeros to beginning of the array while maintaining the order of all non-zero elements. Probably LC Easy/Med

Write a Bubble sort and describe it's complexity
